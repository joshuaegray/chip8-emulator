## CHIP-8 Emulator 

[CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) is a virtual processor designed in the 1970s designed to allow programmers an easier medium to develop games across multiple platforms. The CHIP-8 is not a physical piece of hardware, rather a virtual interpreter that can read a binary file encoded with instructions.

The processor consists of
- An instruction set of 35 2-byte instructions
- 16 8-bit general purpose registers
- A 16-bit index register used to hold memory addresses 
- A 16-bit PC
- An entire 4KB of memory! (4096 bytes 🔥) 

This is my implementation of the legendary processor, written in C++

For testing, I have a series of CHIP-8 roms located inside of `roms/binaries`. These are generated by different python scripts inside of `roms/scripts` (many created with the help of my friend Gemini 😁). 

To generate the binary, run `python3 <script_name>`. 
- Example: `python3 roms/scripts/alu.py`

To run the emulator: `./emulate <path to ROM binary>`
- Example: `./emulate roms/binaries/alu.ch8`
