## CHIP-8 Emulator 

[CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) is a virtual processor designed in the 1970s designed to allow programmers an easier medium to develop games across multiple platforms. The CHIP-8 is not a physical piece of hardware, rather a virtual interpreter that can read a binary file encoded with instructions.

The processor consists of
- An instruction set of 35 2-byte instructions
- 16 8-bit general purpose registers
- A 16-bit index register used to hold memory addresses 
- A 16-bit PC
- An entire 4KB of memory! (4096 bytes 🔥) 

This is my implementation of the legendary processor, written in C++
